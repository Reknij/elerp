# Check the inventory
## Filtering
You can check the results by filtering. For example, you want to check the inventory of warehouse `KL` and only check products with SKU category `Beverages` and less than `450`.  You can do this:

Then click `Filter` to get the results.

## Sorting
You can check the results by sorting. For example, if you want to sort by quantity in ascending order, click the `Quantity` column:
::: tip Not set, default
![Sort example](../assets/inventory-example-sorting-unset.png)
:::

::: tip Ascending order

:::

::: tip Descending order
