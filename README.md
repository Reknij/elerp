# What is this
`Elerp` is a warehouse management system (WMS)/inventory system. The backend uses Rust + Sqlite, and frontend uses Vue + NaiveUI/ElementPlus. I'm not a professional programmer, I just do it for my job.

**Again, I'm not a professional programmer and anyone who wants to contribute code is more than welcome.**
